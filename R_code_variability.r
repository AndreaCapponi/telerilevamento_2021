#The third package to install is ggplot2, which is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on "The Grammar of Graphics". The user provides the data, tell 'ggplot2' how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details:

install.packages("ggplot2")

#The fourth package to install is gridExtra, which provides a number of user-level functions to work with "grid" graphics, notably to arrange multiple grid-based plots on a page, and draw tables: 

install.packages("gridExtra")

#The fifth package to install is viridis, a whole of color maps designed to improve graph readability for readers with common forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color maps are also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to black-and-white for printing. This package also contains 'ggplot2' bindings for discrete and continuous color and fill scales

install.packages("viridis")

#library() is a function which load and attach add-on packages, in this case the previous raster, RStoolbox, ggplot2, gridExtra and viridis packages:

library(raster)

library(RStoolbox)

library(ggplot2)

library(gridExtra)

library(viridis)

#In my computer R must use the folder named simply lab and I exploit a function (setwd) for the association between R and lab folder:

setwd("C:/lab/")

#I exploit a function (brick) to import data from lab folder - external - to R - internal* -:

sentinel <- brick("sentinel.png")

#Important: the brick function creates a RasterBrick object that is a multi-layer raster object typically from a multi-layer (band) file. Instead the raster function creates a RasterLayer object from scratch, a file, an Extent object, a matrix, an 'image' object, or from a Raster *, Spatial *, im (spatstat) asc, kasc (adehabitat *), grf (geoR) or kde object!

#ggRGB() is a function that calculates RGB color composite RasterLayers for plotting with ggplot2. Optional values for clipping and and stretching can be used to enhance the imagery:

plotRGB(sentinel)

#The syntax of the plotRGB() function is different from the standard because the sequence of sentinel bands associated with the R, G and B channels is the one I requested and it is not necessary to specify the arguments

#plotRGB(sentinel) and plotRGB(sentinel, r=1, g=2, b=3, strecht="Lin") will lead the user to the same result!

#How to calculate variance within a satellite image?

#The variance is a numerical measure of how the data values is dispersed around the mean

#The calculation of the variance in a satellite image is to be carried out exclusively on one of its bands selected by the user through the moving window method

#The moving window method depends on the value of the standard deviation (œÉ) calculated on the values of a grid whose size is 3 x 3 pixels

#The final value is associated with the pixel that represents the exact center of the moving window

#The new map obtained externally has non-values while internally the values for the standard deviations to which to attribute different "colors"

#How to merge the three bands of the sentinel satellite image into one so that I can apply the moving window method?

#Name identification for the four sentinel bands is possible from the ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶ùò¥ category in the information summary clicking Enter ‚Üµ as physical command by keyboard:

sentinel

#The relatively sentinel information is contained within the table:

max values :        255,        255,        255,        255

#The satellite bands of interest in sentinel to me are sentinel$sentinel.1 (NIR) and sentinel$sentinel.2 (RED) to which for convenience I gave them a name to facilitate the calculation of NDVI in the following code string:

nir <- sentinel$sentinel.1

red <- sentinel$sentinel.2

#I calculate the NDVI vegetation index as R_code_vegetation_indices.r according to the NDVI formula (NIR-RED) / (NIR + RED):

ndvi <- (nir-red) / (nir+red)

#plot is a common function for plotting of R object and in this case I exploit the previous to visualize spectral bands:

plot(ndvi)

#I exploit a function (colorRampPalette) to create a new palette of colors each one of them is indexed, numbered pixel as virtual box matches numbered color as bit depth:

vcp <- colorRampPalette(c('black','white','red','magenta','green'))(100) 

#plot(ndvi) must be reformulated by incorporating new palette of colors vcp: plot(ndvi,col=vcp) will display graphically reflectance's values in a black, white, red, magenta and green colour scale:

plot(ndvi,col=vcp)

#The functions described so far enable the user to calculate the variability of the sentinel satellite image with the moving window method computationally expressed by the focal () function:

#focal() is a function that calculates focal ("moving window") values for the neighborhood of focal cells using a matrix of weights, perhaps in combination with a function:

#The variance has been defined as a numerical measure of how the data values is dispersed around the mean. If instead I considered it as dispersed around the standard deviation (œÉ)?

ndvisd3 <- focal(ndvi,w=matrix(1/9, nrow=3, ncol=3), fun=sd)

#Attention: The moving window has a square shape in order to avoid the anisotropy, which would compromise the calculation of values for the cartesian axes X and Y by giving an incorrect interpretation by the user!

#plot is a common function for plotting of R object and in this case I exploit the previous to visualize spectral bands:

plot(ndvisd3)

#I exploit a function (colorRampPalette) to create an other palette of colors each one of them is indexed, numbered pixel as virtual box matches numbered color as bit depth:

#The variance has been defined as a numerical measure of how the data values is dispersed around the mean. If instead I considered it according to this definition what would be the difference or what would be the differences in comparison to the standard deviation (œÉ)?

ndvimean3 <- focal(ndvi,w=matrix(1/9, nrow=3, ncol=3), fun=mean)

#plot is a common function for plotting of R object and in this case I exploit the previous to visualize spectral bands:

plot(ndvimean3, col=mncp)

#With the function par() there is the possibility of combining multiple object's level of "interest" into one graphical visualization of their called multiframe:
     
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

sdcp <- colorRampPalette(c('blue','green','pink','magenta','orange','brown','red','yellow'))(100) 

mncp <- colorRampPalette(c('cyan','green','pink','violet','orange','brown','red','golden'))(100) 

plot(ndvisd3, col=sdcp)

plot(ndvimean3, col=mncp)

#After applying the moving window method to the sentinel satellite image, why not change the window size according to the need I might have in statistical analysis?

#Attention! The number of pixels must be an odd number to have in each analysis a single central pixel in the moving window through which to calculate the standard deviation (œÉ)

#focal() is a function that calculates focal ("moving window") values for the neighborhood of focal cells using a matrix of weights, perhaps in combination with a function:

#It is also possible to exploit a multivariate analysis by considering exclusively the PC1 component on which to scroll the moving window, obtaining a map for the variability according to the values of the standard deviation (œÉ)

#I can conduct the principal component analysis or PCA on the sentinel RasterBrick, exploiting the rasterPCA() function which calculates R-mode PCA for RasterBricks or RasterStacks and returns a RasterBrick with multiple layers of PCA scores:
