#1. R code remote sensing

#Title for R's developing code

#My first R code for remote sensing üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª

#Which folder must R use in the computer?

#In the computer R must use the folder named simply lab

#I exploit a function (setwd) for the association between R and lab folder

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: setwd(''C:/lab/'')

#In R function setwd(''C:/lab/'') gives an error: unexpected symbol in (''C:/lab/'')

#The correct and unexpected syntaxis' function is: setwd('C:/lab/')

#After the association between R and lab folder, how I import data from lab folder to R?

#I exploit  a function (brick) to import data from lab folder - external - to R - internal* -

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: renowned object name <- brick('original object name')

#Previous function is based on install.packages('raster'): I indicate to R trough library function to upload them as library(raster) where syntaxis doesn't need inverted commas (‚Äú ‚Äù)* 

#Loading required packages: sp is successful being classes and methods' database provider for spatial data 

#p224r63_2011_masked.grd is imported in R with brick function according to Windows' syntaxis in which: renowned object name = p224r63_2011 and original object name = p224r63_2011_masked.grd

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: p224r63_2011 <- brick('p224r63_2011_masked.grd')

#How to visualize informations of p224r63_2011 in R? 

#In R, visualizing informations of an object, name of it followed by Enter as physical command by keyboard

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: renowned object name ‚Üµ Enter

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: p224r63_2011 ‚Üµ Enter

#Important: any object name includes also informations about the number assigned to a sinusoid on space satellite's path (preceded by p letter) and of any parallel (preceded by letter r) that intersected it in a specific reference system: consequently the name of p224r63 object refers to the sinusoid numbered 224 on LANDSAT's path and to Earth's parallel numbered 63 that intersected the former in WGS84 reference system 

#The reference system further analyzed has been extracted from the informations of a generic object as crs in which the user through R can find in order: projection, zone, datum and units

#crs string in p224r63_2011's informations summary is for example: +proj=utm +zone=22 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs 

#If I want to obtain visually spectral bands in p224r63_2011?

#I exploit  a function (plot) to obtain visually spectral bands¬π

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: plot(object)

#In R function plot(p224r63_2011) lead me to a window with spectral bands explainable graphically through the concept of reflectance

#Unsatisfactory colors may be changed to foster a clear interpretation of reflectance's values from B1_SRE to B7_SRE representing each spectral bands

#I exploit  a function (colorRampPalette) to create a new palette of colors each one of them is indexed: numbered pixel as virtual box matches numbered color as bit depth

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: name of new palette of colors <- colorRampPalette(array('first color','second color',third color','last color')) (number of depth levels for selected colors)

#A further consideration for upper syntaxis' function: array is indicated by c letter‚Å¥ and represents the belonging of new palette's colors to a single object whereas number of depth levels for selected colors is a value freely chosen by the user

#If I want the aforementioned new palette of colors - which is given the name of bgwcp - represents a greyscale, first and last color will be black and white (B/W) respectively whereas second, third, etc. colors will be greys of which the number of depth levels vary from 4 to 256

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: bgwcp <- colorRampPalette(c('black','grey','white'))(100)

#plot(p224r63_2011) must be reformulated by incorporating new palette of colors bgwcp: plot(p224r63_2011, col=bgwcp) will display graphically reflectance's values for each spectral bands in a greyscale

#with what has been described so far, I create a futher new palette of colors called rmpcp in which first, second and last color will be red, magenta and pink respectively with number's value of depth levels taken to the extreme being 1000!

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: rmpcp <- colorRampPalette(c('red','magenta','pink'))(1000)

#If in the final syntaxis' function for Windows systems is included a color (first, second, ..., last) freely selected by the user but unobtainable through an additive color model which is RGB (color gamut is created from red, green and blue as primary colors) therefore will be displayed the underlying string ‚Üì

#Error in col2rgb(colors, alpha = alpha) : invalid color name 'fuchsia' rmpcp <- colorRampPalette(c('red','magenta','fuchsia','pink'))(1000) where fuchsia in RGB's color gamut doesn't exist being unobtainable through the addition of primary colors!

#Adapted R's function plot(p224r63_2011, col=rmpcp)¬≥ will display graphically reflectance's values for each spectral bands in a colorscale invented starting from scratch by the user

#If the user requires adapted R's function plot(p224r63_2011, col=rmpcp) will display graphically reflectance's values for one of the previous spectral bands (B1:blue, B2:green, B3:red, B4:near-infrared, B5:mid-infrared, B6:far-infrared or B7:other mid-infrared)? 

#I exploit a function dev.off() to end a graphical display depending on the R's (plot) function and if it is syntactically correct, the user will see this message appears: null device 1

#Error in dev.off() : cannot shut down the device 1 (dispositivo null) message appears exclusively when the user has closed manually graphical display's window clicking on the x at the top right

#I exploit a function ($) to extract, from the initial (plot)¬π of an object represented by a matrix of data, a set of them that will allow the user to visualize graphically the level of ''interest''

#Initial syntaxis' function for Windows: plot(renowned object name$name of the object's level in which the user is interested for graphical visualization)

#What will be the final syntaxis' function in Windows if my p224r63_2011's level of ''interest''¬≤ is the set of data which will be graphically visualized in their functional whole being as the spectral band B1:blue?

#In progress syntaxis' function in Windows is: plot(p224r63_2011$B1_sre) 

#With plot(p224r63_2011$B1_sre) the user graphically will visualize the spectral band B1_sre:blue stand-alone¬≤ in its reflectance's values which colorscale is ax expected by default in R itself

#plot is a R's function which syntaxis is in that case implemented with colorRampPalette¬≥ in order that I can freely opt for the palette of colors to foster a clear interpretation of reflectance's values from the spectral band B1_sre:blue in replacement of previous and useless R's default palette of colors

#Extended syntaxis' function for Windows: plot(renowned object name$name of the object's level in which the user is interested for graphical visualization, col=name of selected colors' palette)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: plot(p224r63_2011$B1_sre, col=rmpcp), where the palette of colors rmpcp is the one I created in the 33rd string

#For the user $ function's relevance in R is manifest at a higher level with the function (par) through which there is the possibility of combining multiple object's level of ''interest'' into one graphical visualization of their called multiframe

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is:par(multiframe, a graphical visualization of multiple object's level of ''interest'' organized by rÃ≤oÃ≤wÃ≤s or cÃ≤oÃ≤lÃ≤umns at the user's discretion = array‚Å¥(number of rows or columns required, number of columns or rows required))

#How would I combine the spectral bands B1_sre:blue and B2_sre:green as my p224r63_2011's level of ''interest'' from LANDSAT in a single graphic solution in an understandable multiframe for which par will be R's function of choice?

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: par(mfrow=c(1,2)) which has a functional significance if and only followed by plot(p224r63_2011$B1_sre) and plot(p224r63_2011$B2_sre)

#par(mfrow=c(1,2)) and par(mfcol=c(1,2)) syntactically and funtionally are different because the second - compared to the first one - will combine the spectral bands B1_sre:blue and B2_sre:green as my p224r63_2011's level of ''interest'' from LANDSAT in a single graphic visualization solution organizing them by one column and two rows in the required multiframe

#Which could be the final syntaxis' function in Windows if LANDSAT spectral bands of interest to us or to researchers will be B1_sre:blue, B2_sre:green, B3_sre:red and B4_sre:near-infrared (4/7)?

#Along the lines of what was suggested to visualize in a single graphic solution the first two of them through R's par function in multiframe, the final syntaxis' function in Windows will be: par(mfrow=c(4,1)) followed by plot(p224r63_2011$B1_sre), plot(p224r63_2011$B2_sre), plot(p224r63_2011$B3_sre) and plot(p224r63_2011$B4_sre)

#Being the previously selected spectral bands of LANDSAT in even number, the best graphical visualization of B1_sre:blue, B2_sre:green, B3_sre:red and B4_sre:near-infrared is in a two rows x two columns multiframe square generated in a new window starting from an adapted R's function: par(mfrow=c(2,2)) followed by plot(p224r63_2011$B1_sre), plot(p224r63_2011$B2_sre), plot(p224r63_2011$B3_sre) and plot(p224r63_2011$B4_sre)

#plot(p224r63_2011$B1_sre), plot(p224r63_2011$B2_sre), plot(p224r63_2011$B3_sre) and plot(p224r63_2011$B4_sre) should be reformulated by incorporating new palette of colors for reflectance's values in accordance with regions of the electromagnetic spectrum of each bands from B1_sre to B7_sre detectable by LANDSAT satellites

#The aforementioned new palette of colors for reflectance's values in accordance with regions of the electromagnetic spectrum of each bands from B1_sre to B7_sre detectable by LANDSAT satellites through ColorRampPalette are: dbbcfbcp <- colorRampPalette(c("darkblue","blue","cornflowerblue")) (100), ag3sg2sgcp <- colorRampPalette(c("springgreen3","springgreen2","springgreen1")) (100), r4r3r2cp <- colorRampPalette(c("red4","red3","red2")) (100) and do4or1ocp <- colorRampPalette(c("darkorange4","orangered1","orange")) (100)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: par(mfrow=c(2,2)) dbbcfbcp <- colorRampPalette(c("darkblue","blue","cornflowerblue")) followed by (100) plot(p224r63_2011$B1_sre, col=dbbcfbcp), ag3sg2sgcp <- colorRampPalette(c("springgreen3","springgreen2","springgreen1")) (100) followed by plot(p224r63_2011$B2_sre, col=ag3sg2sgcp), r4r3r2cp <- colorRampPalette(c("red4","red3","red2")) (100) followed by plot(p224r63_2011$B2_sre, col=r4r3r2cp) and do4or1ocp <- colorRampPalette(c("darkorange4","orangered1","orange")) (100) followed by plot(p224r63_2011$B4_sre, col=do4or1ocp)

#The graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in true colors, being LANDSAT equipped with true colour, thermal and multispectral sensors in a complex acquisition system, will be obtained from the visible spectrum to which I associate B1_sre:blue, B2_sre:green, B3_sre:red spectral bands of the initial object

#This graphical visualization in true colors is therefore in RGB and independent from user's selection of a palette of colors through colorRampPalette function because the three levels of interest selected by the user herself/himself from B1_sre to B7_sre are combined such that they represent exclusively the red‚Åµ, green‚Å∂ and blue‚Å∑ channel in true colour sensors of LANDSAT satellite

#Syntax's function for Windows is: plotRGB(renowned object name, r= number of selected spectral band which will be graphically visualized through red channel, g= number of selected spectral band which will be graphically visualized through green channel, b= number of selected spectral band which will be graphically visualized through blue channel,type of stretch for reflectance's values in order that their graphical visualization is optimal ='Lin if the stretch has to normalize reflectance's values between 0 e 1 (œÅ=Œ¶r/Œ¶0)' or 'hist if the stretch has to divides the reflectance's values into equally sized ranges from the lowest to the highest value') where the number of selected spectral band is to be indicated being a integer function!

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=1, stretch='Lin')

#The graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in false color, not being the human eye thermal and multispectral sensors in a biological complex acquisition system, will be obtained by substituting B1_sre:blue spectral band with B4_sre:near-infrared, B5_sre:mid-infrared, B6_sre:far-infrared or B7_sre:other mid-infrared spectral bands on a case by case basis in remote sensing analysis

#For example in the graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in true colors vegetational coverage of the Amazon rainforest isn't appreciable through this remote sensing analysis because the maximum reflectance's value for leaves is to be found in near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in false color based on B4:near-infrared spectral band allows the user to appreciate through this new and adapted remote sensing analysis the vegetational coverage of the Amazon rainforest

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch='Lin') if the graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in false color for vegetational coverage of the Amazon rainforest is through the red channel‚Åµ

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=4, b=2, stretch='Lin') if the graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in false color for vegetational coverage of the Amazon rainforest is through the green channel‚Å∂

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=4, stretch='Lin') if the graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in false color for vegetational coverage of the Amazon rainforest is through the blue channel‚Å∑

#Through par function the user will be able to combine the four doable graphical visualizations of p224r63_2011 in true and false colors for vegetational coverage of the Amazon rainforest in a two rows x two columns multiframe square as described in the 55th string

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: par(mfrow=c(2,2)) followed by plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=1, stretch='Lin'), plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch='Lin'),plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=4, b=2, stretch='Lin') and plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=4, stretch='Lin')

#I exploit a function (pdf) to produce PDF graphics

#Syntax's function for Windows is: pdf('name of the future PDF graphic.pdf')

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: pdf('RGBAmazonRainforest.pdf'), par(mfrow=c(2,2)) followed by plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=1, stretch='Lin'), plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch='Lin'), plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=4, b=2, stretch='Lin') and plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=4, stretch='Lin') at the end dev.off() for graphics cleaning

#Another final syntaxis' for plotRGB function in Windows could be: plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=4, b=2, stretch='hist') if the graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in false color for vegetational coverage of the Amazon rainforest was through the green channel‚Å∂ and the type of stretch for reflectance's values in order that its graphical visualization was optimal in histogram

#How the graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in false color will be for vegetational coverage of the Amazon rainforest through the green channel‚Å∂ and if the type of stretch for reflectance's values in order that its graphical visualization is optimal in histogram?

#Through par function I will be able to combine the graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in true colors, in false color through the green channel in a plotRGB where the selected stretch is LÃ≤iÃ≤nÃ≤ear and in false color through the green channel in a plotRGB where on the contrary selected stretch is hiÃ≤sÃ≤tÃ≤ogram organizing them by three rows and one column in a intriguing multiframe

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: par(mfrow=c(3,1)) followed by plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=2, b=1, stretch='Lin'), plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=4, b=2, stretch='Lin') and plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=4, b=2, stretch='hist')

#The final conclusion from an accurate comparison of previous p224r63_2011 graphical and multiframe visualizations of vegetational coverage localized in the Amazon rainforest trough three different plotRGB is that with the last plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=3, g=4, b=2, stretch='hist') will be visible also its river basin/catchment basin made up of springs, rivers, lakes and swamps!

#So far it would seem to exist a single example of the LANDSAT space satellite when instead, being a joint space program of NASA and USGS, there have been 8 satellites with this name from the first launch on 6 January 1978 for LANDSAT 1 up to arrive at LANDSAT 8 launched on 11 February 2013. Continuity in collecting data by remote sensing is essential to study the evolution of the environment, resources and the natural and man-made changes that have occurred on the earth's surface!

#In R I can import an image of the vegetation cover for the Amazon forest that is antecedent to that of 2011 (this is possible due to the continuity in LANDSAT joint space program of NASA and USGS just mentioned in the string above ‚Üë) and analyze whether there has been an expansion or reduction of it depending on the anthropic activities in Brazil

#As in the beginning, I exploit setwd function for the association between R and lab folder

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: setwd('C:/lab/')

#After the association between R and lab folder, how I import data from lab folder to R?

#I exploit a function (brick) to import data from lab folder - external - to R - internal*-

#Previous function is based on install.packages('raster'): I indicate to R trough library function to upload them as library(raster) where syntaxis doesn't need inverted commas (‚Äú ‚Äù)* 

#Loading required packages: sp is successful being classes and methods' database provider for spatial data name of the package the user be in need of

#Important: the installation of a package that the user be in need of through install.packages function must be done only after the launch of R because if necessary it is the library function that loads the package mentioned and previously installed!

#p224r63_1988_masked.grd is imported in R with brick function according to Windows' syntaxis in which: renowned object name = p224r63_1988 and original object name = p224r63_1988_masked.grd

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: renowned object name <- brick('original object name')

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: p224r63_1988 <- brick('p224r63_1988_masked.grd')

#How to visualize informations of p224r63_1988 in R?

#Syntax's function for Windows is: plot(object)

#In R function plot(p224r63_1988) lead me to a window with spectral bands explainable graphically through the concept of reflectance

#Initially a multitemporal differentiation in the vegetation cover of the Amazon rainforest could be appreciable through a false color graphic visualization with the plotRGB function of p224r63_1988 and p224r63_2011 in the red channel of LANDSAT's sensors with a syntax R = B4_sre: near-infrared, G = B3_sre: red and B = B2_sre: green with linear strecht Lin organizing them in a multiframe of two rows and a column with the function par so that there is no overlapping of successive plotRGB for a single image!

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: par(mfrow=c(2,1)) followed by plotRGB(p224r63_1988, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch="Lin") and plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch="Lin")

#Subsequently, to analyze the multitemporal differentiation in the vegetation cover of the Amazon forest by remote sensing beyond the annoying background haze, the previous false color graphic visualization with the plotRGB function of p224r63_1988 and p224r63_2011 in the red channel of LANDSAT's sensors could have a syntax R = B4_sre: near-infrared, G = B3_sre: red and B = B2_sre: green but with both linear (Lin) and histogram (his) strecht organizing them in a square multiframe of two rows and two columns with the same function par and being saved as a PDF with the name of AmazonRainforestMultitemporalDifferentiation

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: pdf('AmazonRainforestMultitemporalDifferentiation.pdf'), par(mfrow=c(2,2)) followed by plotRGB(p224r63_1988, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch='Lin'), plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch='Lin'), plotRGB(p224r63_1988, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch='hist') and plotRGB(p224r63_2011, r=4, g=3, b=2, stretch='hist')

#2. R time code series

#Which is the title for R's developing code?

#My R code for a time series ‚è±Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

#Which folder must R use in the computer for this new code?

#In the computer R must use the subfolder named greenland within the "mother" folder simply called lab

#I exploit a function (setwd) for the association between R and greenland subfolder

#Adapted syntaxis' function for Windows is: setwd("C:/name of the folder in which there is a subfolder of interest to the user/name of the subfolder which will be associated with R")

#Final syntaxis' function for Windows is: setwd("C:/lab/greenland")

#After the association between R and greenland subfolder, how I import data from greenland subfolder to R?

#In a different way from the R_remote_code_sensing_first.r, although I still exploit a function to import data from greenland subfolder - external - to R - internal¬π - this will be raster and not brick because our data does not represent a multi-layer raster object¬≥ but raster layer¬≤ objects!

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: renowned object name <- raster("original object name")

#Previous function is based on install.packages("raster"): I indicate to R trough library function to upload them as library(raster) where syntaxis doesn't need inverted commas (‚Äú ‚Äù)¬π 

#Important: the brick function creates a RasterBrick object that is a multi-layer raster object typically from a multi-layer (band) file. Instead the raster function creates a RasterLayer object from scratch, a file, an Extent object, a matrix, an 'image' object, or from a Raster *, Spatial *, im (spatstat) asc, kasc (adehabitat *), grf (geoR) or kde object!

#Loading required packages: sp is successful being classes and methods' database provider for spatial data 

#For the operation of this code, it is recommended by the professor to install also install.packages("RStoolbox") and install.packages("rasterVis") in order to have tools and visualization methods for remote sensing data analysis

#Through install.packages("RStoolbox") the user have a diversied toolbox for remote sensing image processing and analysis as calculating spectral indices, principal component transformation, unsupervised and supervised classification or fractional cover analyses

#Through install.packages("rasterVis") the user have methods to apply for an enhanced visualization and interaction with raster data.

It also provides methods to display spatiotemporal rasters, and vector fields

#The rasterVis package installation incorporates preexisting lattice and latticeExtra packages: lattice is a powerful and elegant high-level data visualization system inspired by Trellis graphics, with an emphasis on multivariate data while latticeExtra provides several new high-level functions and methods to lattice itself  

#lst_2000.tif, lst_2005.tif, lst_2010.tif and lst_2015.tif are imported in R with raster function according to Windows' syntaxis in which: renowned object name = lst_2000,lst_2005, lst_2010 and lst_2015 and original object name = lst_2000.tif, lst_2005.tif, lst_2010.tif and lst_2015.tif

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: lst_2000 <- raster("lst_2000.tif"),lst_2000 <- raster("lst_2005.tif"), lst_2010 <- raster("lst_2010.tif") and lst_2015 <- raster("lst_2015.tif")

#How to graphically visualize the Earth's surface temperature in Greenland from raster layer objects lst_2000, lst_2005, lst_2010 and lst_2015 (lst, acronym for land surface temperature)?

#I exploit a function (plot) to obtain visually land surface temperature

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: plot(object)

#In R function plot(lst_2000), plot(lst_2005), plot(lst_2010) and plot(last_2015) lead me to a window with land surface temperature of Greenland explainable graphically through the concept of reflectance

#With the function (par) there is the possibility of combining in this case multiple levels of "interest" belonging to different objects¬≤ in their series into one graphical visualization of their called multiframe

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: par(multiframe, a graphical visualization of multiple levels of "interest" belonging to different objects¬≤ in their series organized by rÃ≤oÃ≤wÃ≤s or cÃ≤oÃ≤lÃ≤umns at the user's discretion = array(number of rows or columns required, number of columns or rows required))

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: par(mfrow=c(2,2)) followed by plot(lst_2000), plot(lst_2010), plot(lst_2010) and plot(lst_2015)

#The plot and par functions applied individually by the user to each raster layer object are a slow and inefficient iterative cycle! 

#What if I import the four rasters lst_2000, lst_2010, lst_2010 and lst_2015 at the same time in R via the raster function by selecting them from a list in the greenland subfolder? Subsequently, by representing each raster¬≤ the Earth's surface temperature for Greenland in different years (2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015), I would join the latter as levels of a single object¬≥, the plot of which will clarify graphically the trend of the previous temperature in a time series analysis

#Initially I exploit a function (rlist) through which I create a list of data, files or objects based on the matching of their names with a key regular expression selected by the user

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: name of the list of objects selected by the user <- list.files(pattern="a key regular expression in each name of previous objects of which the user is creating a list") 

#Since the number of my objects is limited, I could have the tif format as a pattern in the rlist function. This user choice is not recommended because the tif format is common and widespread so my choice will be the lst pattern indicating in each raster what represents in particular (land surface temperature)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: greenlandsubfolderlist <- list.files(pattern="lst")

#After the creation of the list greenlandsubfolderlist consisting of lst_2000, lst_2005, lst_2010 and lst_2015, how to import it by applying the raster function globally?

#I exploit a function (lapply) which apply a selected function by the user in R over a list

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: name of the list of objects on which is applied the function selected by the user <- lapply(original name of the list of objects on which will be applied the function selected by the user, selected function by the user)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: greenlandimportedr <- lapply(greenlandsubfolderlist,raster)

#The display of the information of lst_2000, lst_2005, lst_2010 and lst_2015 is done simply by pressing ‚Üµ Enter after I have digitized greenlandimportedr where the rasters are listed with numbers between square brackets from [1] to [4]

#The last operation will be to merge the raster layer objects lst_2000, lst_2005, lst_2010 and lst_2015 - contained in the greenlandimportedr list imported into R - into a multi-layer raster object whose name I have chosen will be TCSG through a new function called stack 

#I exploit the (stack) function that stack or unstack vectors from a data frame or list generated by the user beforehand

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: name of the future multi-layer raster object <- stack(name of the list of objects on which the function selected by the user is applied to import them into R)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: TCSG <- stack(greenlandimportedr)

#Without exploiting the plot function singularly on each raster layer object and organizing the same raster layer objects in a prearrenged multiframe through the par function, the iterative cycle of the rlist, lapply and stack functions guarantees to any user the exploitation of plot function directly on the multilevel raster object as the one created in the 42nd string of this code!

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: plot(TCSG)

#The graphical visualization of the increase in the surface temperature of the Earth in Greenland is obtained through a more detailed plot in RGB: I associate the levels of "interest" in TCSG multilayer raster object - which initially were a series of raster layer objects stand alone - to the channels of the red, green and blue for the multispectral sensors the LANDSAT satellite is equipped with

#Syntax's function for Windows is: plotRGB(renowned object name, r= number of selected spectral band which will be graphically visualized through red channel, g= number of selected spectral band which will be graphically visualized through green channel, b= number of selected spectral band which will be graphically visualized through blue channel,type of stretch for reflectance's values in order that their graphical visualization is optimal ='Lin if the stretch has to normalize reflectance's values between 0 e 1 (œÅ=Œ¶r/Œ¶0)' or 'hist if the stretch has to divides the reflectance's values into equally sized ranges from the lowest to the highest value') where the number of selected spectral band is to be indicated being a integer function!

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: plotRGB(TCSG, 1, 2, 3, stretch="Lin"), plotRGB(TCSG, 2, 3, 4, stretch="Lin") and plotRGB(TCSG, 4, 3, 2, stretch="Lin") where r, g and b could be implied!

#For a graphical visualization of the melting ice in Greenland depending on the Earth's surface temperature, it is possible to exploit another plot function that for the TCSG multi-layer raster object pools a legend for the reflectance values at lst_2000, lst_2005, lst_2010 and lst_2015?

#I exploit a function (levelplot) to draw level plots and contour plots

#Important: the above function is operative if and only if the user with the library function loads the previously installed rasterVis package

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: library(add-on package the user wants to load in R)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: library(rsaterVis)

#Instead the syntax for the levelplot function in Windows is: levelplot(name of the multi-layer object selected by the user)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: levelplot(TCSG)

#And if I wanted to apply the levelplot function to the single TCSG layer represented by my choice among the raster layer objects lst_2000, lst_2005, lst_2010 and lst_2015?

#I exploit a function ($) to extract, from the initial (plot)¬π of an object represented by a matrix of data, a set of them that will allow the user to visualize graphically the level of ''interest''

#Initial syntaxis' function for Windows: plot(renowned object name$name of the object's level in which the user is interested for graphical visualization)

#What will be the final syntaxis' function in Windows if my p224r63_2011's level of ''interest''¬≤ is the set of data which will be graphically visualized in their functional whole being as the spectral band B1:blue?

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: levelplot(TCSG$lst_2000), levelplot(TCSG$lst_2005), levelplot(TCSG$lst_2010) and levelplot(TCSG$lst_2015)

#The graphical display through the levelplot function of the level raster objects lst_2000, lst_2005, lst_2010 and lst_2015 as layers of the TCSG multilevel raster object is more detailed: the temperature trend on the earth's surface is represented by a graph - above and to the right of it - whose values are attributed by row or column as the sum of the values belonging to the nth row or column in relation to the total number of pixels. If the number of pixels is equal to 16, 2 to 16 = 65,536 will be the average values potentially attributable in the form of bits so that it can be understood even for a single pixel if in a predetermined time span there has been an imperceptible variation of that temperature!

#The graphical display of TCSG through levelplot function can be embellished by integrating the syntax of the function with the arguments to specify what is the user's need in the analysis of the temperature in Greenland. In my case I need to apply a new color palette for the correct interpretation of the reflectance values, change the name of the layers / raster objects of the layer and put a title on the graph itself

#I exploit a function (colorRampPalette) to create a new palette of colors each one of them is indexed: numbered pixel as virtual box matches numbered color as bit depth

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: name of new palette of colors <- colorRampPalette(array('first color','second color',third color','last color')) (number of depth levels for selected colors)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: blbprcp <- colorRampPalette(c("blue","light blue","pink","red"))(100)

#Implemented syntaxis' function in Windows is: levelplot(name of the multi-layer object selected by the user, col.regions= name of new palette of colors)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: levelplot(TCSG, col.regions=blbprcp)

#Without exploiting any function, I manually select and insert the name (s) for the layer (s) of the multi layer object - which will be July 2000, July 2005, July 2010 and July 2015 - in the names.attr argument integrating in the preceding syntaxis of the levelplot function

#Implemented syntaxis' function in Windows is: levelplot(name of the multi-layer object selected by the user, col.regions= name of new palette of colors, names.attr=c("user-selected name (s) for the layer (s) of multi-layer object)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: levelplot(TCSG, col.regions=cl, names.attr=c("July 2000","July 2005", "July 2010", "July 2015"))

#Finally I integrate in the syntaxis of the levelplot function the main argument to put a title to the graph that clarifies how the temperature of Earth's surface - reported in the legend for the four raster layer objects as reflectance values - have changed over time

#Implemented syntaxis' function in Windows is: levelplot(name of the multi-layer object selected by the user, col.regions= name of new palette of colors, main=''title of the graphical visualization", names.attr=c("user-selected name (s) for the layer (s) of multi-layer object)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: levelplot(TCSG,col.regions=cl, main="LST variation in time", names.attr=c("July 2000","July 2005", "July 2010", "July 2015"))

#The graphic visualization of the amount of melted ice depending on the surface temperature of the Earth in Greenland is obtained with the same iterative cycle of list.files, lapply and stack functions but starting from level raster objects obtained from the Nimbus 7 satellite between 1979 and 2007 through its own microwave sensor

#Initially I exploit a function (rlist) through which I create a list of data, files or objects based on the matching of their names with a key regular expression selected by the user

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: name of the list of objects selected by the user <- list.files(pattern="a key regular expression in each name of previous objects of which the user is creating a list")

#Since the number of my objects is limited, I could have the tif format as a pattern in the rlist function. This user choice is not recommended because the tif format is common and widespread so my choice will be the melt pattern indicating in each raster what represents in particular (amount of melted ice)

#Attention! The zip folder whose name is melt could be integrated into this iterative loop of functions and halt the process for the analysis I'm conducting!

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: meltlist <- list.files(pattern="melt")

#After the creation of the list meltlist consisting of 1979annual_melt to 2007annual_melt, how to import it by applying the raster function globally?

#I exploit a function (lapply) which apply a selected function by the user in R over a list

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: name of the list of objects on which is applied the function selected by the user <- lapply(original name of the list of objects on which will be applied the function selected by the user, selected function by the user)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: melt_import <- lapply(meltlist,raster)

#The last operation will be to merge the raster layer objects from 1979annual_melt to 2007annual_melt - contained in the melt_import list imported into R - into a multi-layer raster object whose name I have chosen will be melt through a new function called stack 

#I exploit the (stack) function that stack or unstack vectors from a data frame or list generated by the user beforehand

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: name of the future multi-layer raster object <- stack(name of the list of objects on which the function selected by the user is applied to import them into R)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: melt <- stack(melt_import)

#The display of the information of melt is done simply by pressing ‚Üµ Enter

#For a graphical visualization of the melting ice in Greenland depending on the Earth's surface temperature, why not take advantage of the levelplot function that I introduced in this code?

#Syntaxis' function for Windows as in the 53rd string of R_code_time_series.r is: levelplot(name of the multi-layer object selected by the user)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: levelplot(melt)

#The above levelplot function on the multi-layer raster object melt leads to a graphical visualization that is difficult to interpret since it consists of each raster layer objects from 1979annual_melt to 2007annual_melt - contained in the melt_import list imported previously into R -. Despite the values for the x and y axes and the legend for the reflectance values, the user is unable to conclude what could be the amount of melted ice in Greenland in that time window. What solution to adopt?

#The solution to be adopted is to create a new raster layer object that shows in a single graphic solution the amount of melted ice in Greenland on the difference between the initial and final state represented respectively by the 1979annual_melt and 2007annual_melt raster layer objects

#The new raster layer object, to which I will give the name melt_amount, is created by a simple subtraction among the already selected raster layer objects 1979annual_melt and 2007annual_melt representing minuend and subtrahend respectively

#melt_amount <- melt$X2007annual_melt - melt$X1979annual_melt

#Attention! The $ function is essential to tell R how the raster layer objects 2007annual_melt and 1979annual_melt belong to melt although were originated in TCSG 

#Not being R's default color palette satisfactory, I exploit a function (colorRampPalette) to create a new palette of colors each one of them is indexed: numbered pixel as virtual box matches numbered color as bit depth

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: name of new palette of colors <- colorRampPalette(array('first color','second color',third color','last color')) (number of depth levels for selected colors)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: bwrcp <- colorRampPalette(c("blue","white","red"))(100)

#I exploit a function (plot) to obtain visually the amount of melted ice

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: plot(melt_amount, col=bwrcp)

#I exploit a function (levelplot) to draw level plots and contour plots

#Instead the syntax for the levelplot function in Windows is: levelplot(name of the multi-layer object selected by the user)

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: levelplot(melt_amount, col.regions=bwrcp)

#The graphical visualization of melt_amount with the plot and levelplot functions is easily interpretable for reflectance values obtained from the Nimbus 7 satellite which, through the three colors - white, red and blue - of the palette of colors called bwrcp, show those regions of Greenland where there was a significant loss of ice due to the increase in the Earth's surface temperature between 1979 and 2007

#Why does the background in the plot change (snowcover2021, col = sc21gbwcp) is green as if there is no snow cover?

#The NÃ≤ot AÃ≤ssigned values (NA) in the background of the plot (snowcover2021, col = sc21gbwcp) are to be reclassified because there is no association with the values in reality!

#reclassify() is a function which reclassify values of a Raster* object. The function (re)classifies groups of values to other values. For example, all values between 1 and 10 become 1, and all values between 11 and 15 become 2:

snowcover2021reclassified <- raster::reclassify(snowcover2021, cbind(252,255, NA), right=TRUE)

#The classification of a satellite image depends on the reflectance values attributed to each pixel

#The values for reflectance vary in the red, green and blue (RGB) bands and two or more pixels will be "merged" to form a class if and only if they have a superimposable value

#These pixels will be placed in a multispectral region as a point cloud which, together with others in a three-dimensional reference system, define the spectrum through which the satellite image is displayed

#The above classification can be effectuated with a training set consisting of: 1) a reference satellite image and 2) the model with which there should be a classification of the pixels depending on their reflectance values or with the unsuperClass () function, where the classification of pixels depending on their reflectance values, on the other hand, occurs randomly!

#The unsupervised Classification () function randomly classifies the sampled pixels (whose number can be indicated in the nSamples argument) depending on their reflectance values, according to the number of classes selected by the user via the nClasses argument:

#7. R code ggplot2

#Creating elegant data visualisations using the "Grammar of Graphics": the case of ggplot2 üìà

#install.packages() is a function which download and install packages from CRAN-like repositories or from local files

#The first package to install is raster through which is possible reading, writing, manipulating, analyzing and modeling of spatial data. The package implements basic and high-level functions for raster data and for vector data operations such as intersections:

install.packages("raster")

#The second package to install is RStoolbox, a toolbox for remote sensing image processing and analysis such as calculating spectral indices, principal component transformation, unsupervised and supervised classification or fractional cover analyses:

install.packages("RStoolbox")

#The third package to install is ggplot2, which is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on "The Grammar of Graphics". The user provides the data, tell 'ggplot2' how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details:

install.packages(ggplot2)

#The fourth package to install is gridExtra, which provides a number of user-level functions to work with "grid" graphics, notably to arrange multiple grid-based plots on a page, and draw tables: 

install.packages(gridExtra)

#library() is a function which load and attach add-on packages, in this case the previous raster, RStoolbox, ggplot2 and gridExtra packages:

library(raster)

library(RStoolbox)

library(ggplot2)

library(gridExtra)

#In my computer R must use the folder named simply lab and I exploit a function (setwd) for the association between R and lab folder:

#The graphical visualization of p224r63 in true colors, being LANDSAT equipped with true colour, thermal and multispectral sensors in a complex acquisition system, will be obtained from the visible spectrum to which I associate B1_sre:blue, B2_sre:green, B3_sre:red spectral bands of the initial object

ggRGB(p224r63,3,2,1, stretch="lin")

#This graphical visualization in true colors is therefore in RGB and independent from user's selection of a palette of colors through colorRampPalette function because the three levels of interest selected by the user herself/himself from B1_sre to B7_sre are combined such that they represent exclusively the red, green and blue channel in true colour sensors of LANDSAT satellite

#The graphical visualization of p224r63 in false color, not being the human eye thermal and multispectral sensors in a biological complex acquisition system, will be obtained by substituting B1_sre:blue spectral band with B4_sre:near-infrared, B5_sre:mid-infrared, B6_sre:far-infrared or B7_sre:other mid-infrared spectral bands on a case by case basis in remote sensing analysis

ggRGB(p224r63,4,3,2, stretch="lin")

#This is the graphical visualization of p224r63_2011 in false color for vegetational coverage of the Amazon rainforest through the red channel

#The components r, g and b in defining the syntax of the plotRGB () or ggRGB () function can be omitted and replaced by the numbers that identify the bands (B1_sre: blue spectral band with B4_sre: near-infrared, B5_sre: mid-infrared, B6_sre: far-infrared or B7_sre: other mid-infrared spectral bands if the satellite is always Landsat) to be displayed through those channels as a single satellite image!

#arrangeGrob set up a gtable layout to place multiple grobs on a page. In particular grid.arrange() draw on the current device and is useful to organize ggRGB elements after simply renamed them:

#8. R code vegetation indices

#Which is the title for R's developing code?

#Which folder must R use in the computer?

#In the computer R must use the folder named simply lab

#I exploit a function (setwd) for the association between R and lab folder

#Final syntaxis' function for Windows is: setwd("C:/lab/greenland")

#After the association between R and lab folder, how I import data from lab folder to R?

#Identically to the R_remote_code_sensing_first.r, I still exploit a function to import data from lab folder - external - to R - internal¬π - and this will be brick and not raster because our data does not represent raster layer objects but multi-layer raster objects¬≤¬≥!

#Syntaxis' function for Windows is: renowned object name <- brick("original object name")

#Previous function is based on install.packages("raster"): I indicate to R trough require function to upload them as require(raster) where syntaxis doesn't need inverted commas (‚Äú ‚Äù)¬π 

#What is the difference between the library function and the require function in loading a user-requested packages into R?

#The library function, if the requested package does not exist, by default returns an error message: there is no package called (name of the package requested by the user to load in R) while the require function is designed to be used inside functions as it gives a warning message and returns a logical value say, FALSE if the requested package is not found and TRUE if the package is loaded

#Loading required packages: sp is successful being classes and methods' database provider for spatial data 

#Important: the brick function creates a RasterBrick object that is a multi-layer raster object typically from a multi-layer (band) file. Instead the raster function creates a RasterLayer object from scratch, a file, an Extent object, a matrix, an 'image' object, or from a Raster *, Spatial *, im (spatstat) asc, kasc (adehabitat *), grf (geoR) or kde object!

#defor1.jpg¬π and defor2.jpg¬≤ are imported in R with brick function according to Windows' syntaxis in which: renowned object name = defor1, defor2 and original object name = defor1.jpg, defor2.jpg

#Final syntaxis' function in Windows is: defor1 <- brick("defor1.jpg") and defor2 <- brick("defor2.jpg")           

#The graphical visualization of both defor1 and defor2 in false colors, being Terra (EOS AM-1) equipped with true colour, thermal and multispectral sensors in a complex acquisition system, will be obtained from the visible spectrum to which I associate B1_sre:NIR, B2_sre:red, B3_sre:grenn spectral bands of the initial object

#This graphical visualization in true colors is therefore in RGB and independent from user's selection of a palette of colors through colorRampPalette function because the three levels of interest selected by the user herself/himself from B1_sre to B3_sre are combined such that they represent exclusively the red‚Åµ, green‚Å∂ and blue‚Å∑ channel in true colour sensors of LANDSAT satellite         

#Syntax's function for Windows is: plotRGB(renowned object name, r= number of selected spectral band which will be graphically visualized through red channel, g= number of selected spectral band which will be graphically visualized through green channel, b= number of selected spectral band which will be graphically visualized through blue channel,type of stretch for reflectance's values in order that their graphical visualization is optimal ='Lin if the stretch has to normalize reflectance's values between 0 e 1 (œÅ=Œ¶r/Œ¶0)' or 'hist if the stretch has to divides the reflectance's values into equally sized ranges from the lowest to the highest value') where the number of selected spectral band is to be indicated being a integer function!

#The study by remote sensing of deforestation in the dry tropical forests of Mato Grosso (NT0140) is based on vegetation indices (VIs)

#What is a vegetation index (VI)?

#A vegetation index (VI) is a measure of vegetation properties calculated by the amount of solar radiation reflected in the optical spectrum

#The spectral signature of healthy vegetation depends on the higher reflectance values of 0,7 to 1,1 ¬µm in the near infrared (NIR) region than in the visible region due to the cellular structure of the leaves - in particular the spongy mesophyll - where almost all of the light is absorbed by photosynthetic pigments. Chlorophyll intensely absorbs energy in the blue and red wavelengths from 0,4 a 0,7 ¬µm, reflecting in the green wavelength instead. Finally, the reflectance in the short wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths is related to the water content of the vegetation with absorption bands around 1.45, 1.95 and 2.50 ¬µm. Outside of these absorption bands, leaf reflectance generally increases as the water content in the leaf decreases!

#DVI (DÕüifference VÕüegetation IÕündex) is the simplest vegetation index calculated as the difference between the near-infrared and red values: DVI = NIR - R

#The ASTER sensor of the Terra satellite (EOS AM-1) has 14 channels for wavelength values in the visible, NIR, SWIR and LWIR. Through the bands B1, B2, B3N and B3B belonging to the visible and NIR spectrum - because their wavelengths are between 0.520 ¬µm and 0.860 ¬µm - it is possible to obtain the reflectance values necessary for the calculation of the DVI index in dry tropical forests del Mato Grosso (NT0140)

#How to progress to the name with the previous bands B1, B2, B3N and B3B are identified within the object of interest defor1?

#The classification of a satellite image depends on the reflectance values attributed to each pixel

#The values for reflectance vary in the red, green and blue (RGB) bands and two or more pixels will be "merged" to form a class if and only if they have a superimposable value

#These pixels will be placed in a multispectral region as a point cloud which, together with others in a three-dimensional reference system, define the spectrum through which the satellite image is displayed

#The above classification can be effectuated with a training set consisting of: 1) a reference satellite image and 2) the model with which there should be a classification of the pixels depending on their reflectance values or with the unsuperClass () function, where the classification of pixels depending on their reflectance values, on the other hand, occurs randomly!

#How to calculate variance within a satellite image?

#The variance is a numerical measure of how the data values is dispersed around the mean

#The calculation of the variance in a satellite image is to be carried out exclusively on one of its bands selected by the user through the moving window method

#The moving window method depends on the value of the standard deviation (œÉ) calculated on the values of a grid whose size is 3 x 3 pixels

#The final value is associated with the pixel that represents the exact center of the moving window

#The new map obtained externally has non-values while internally the values for the standard deviations to which to attribute different "colors"

#How to merge the three bands of the sentinel satellite image into one so that I can apply the moving window method?

#Name identification for the four sentinel bands is possible from the ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶ùò¥ category in the information summary clicking Enter ‚Üµ as physical command by keyboard:

#The relatively sentinel information is contained within the table:

max values :        255,        255,        255,        255

#The satellite bands of interest in sentinel to me are sentinel$sentinel.1 (NIR) and sentinel$sentinel.2 (RED) to which for convenience I gave them a name to facilitate the calculation of NDVI in the following code string:

nir <- sentinel$sentinel.1

red <- sentinel$sentinel.2

#I calculate the NDVI vegetation index as R_code_vegetation_indices.r according to the NDVI formula (NIR-RED) / (NIR + RED):

ndvi <- (nir-red) / (nir+red)

#plot is a common function for plotting of R object and in this case I exploit the previous to visualize spectral bands:

#I exploit a function (colorRampPalette) to create a new palette of colors each one of them is indexed, numbered pixel as virtual box matches numbered color as bit depth:

vcp <- colorRampPalette(c('black','white','red','magenta','green'))(100) 

#plot(ndvi) must be reformulated by incorporating new palette of colors vcp: plot(ndvi,col=vcp) will display graphically reflectance's values in a black, white, red, magenta and green colour scale:

plot(ndvi,col=vcp)

#The functions described so far enable the user to calculate the variability of the sentinel satellite image with the moving window method computationally expressed by the focal () function:

#focal() is a function that calculates focal ("moving window") values for the neighborhood of focal cells using a matrix of weights, perhaps in combination with a function:

#The variance has been defined as a numerical measure of how the data values is dispersed around the mean. If instead I considered it as dispersed around the standard deviation (œÉ)?

#PÃ≤rincipal CÃ≤omponents AÃ≤nalysis (PCA) is a technique applied to multispectral and hyperspectral remotely sensed data
                                
#PCA transforms an original correlated dataset into a substantially smaller set of uncorrelated variables that represents most of the information present in the original dataset
                                
#Instead of throwing away the redundant data, PCA condenses the information in intercorrelated variables into a few variables, called principal components
                                
#The first PÃ≤rincipal CÃ≤component (PC) accounts for maximum proportion of variance from the original dataset
                                
#All subsequent orthogonal components account for the maximum proportion of the remaining variance
                                
#Usually, PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3 account for the vast majority of the variance found within the dataset  
                                
#If, for example, components 1, 2, and 3 account for the majority of the variance found within the dataset, it can be possible to set the original bands aside, and the remainder of the image enhancement or classification process can be performed using just these three PC images 
                                
#Additionally, researchers can utilize PCs along with original bands to produce the desired combination for analysis

#I can conduct the principal component analysis or PCA on the sentinel RasterBrick, exploiting the rasterPCA() function which calculates R-mode PCA for RasterBricks or RasterStacks and returns a RasterBrick with multiple layers of PCA scores:
