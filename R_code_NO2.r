# 1. Set working directory EN
#Which is the title for R's developing code?
#My R code for a time series
#Which folder must R use in the computer for this new code?
#In the computer R must use the subfolder named greenland within the "mother" folder simply called lab
#I exploit a function (setwd) for the association between R and greenland subfolder
#Adapted syntaxis' function for Windows is: setwd("C:/name of the folder in which there is a subfolder of interest to the user/name of the subfolder which will be associated with R")
#Final syntaxis' function for Windows is: setwd("C:/lab/greenland")
