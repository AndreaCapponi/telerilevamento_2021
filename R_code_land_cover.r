#install.packages() is a function which download and install packages from CRAN-like repositories or from local files

#The first package to install is raster through which is possible reading, writing, manipulating, analyzing and modeling of spatial data. The package implements basic and high-level functions for raster data and for vector data operations such as intersections:

install.packages("raster")

#The second package to install is RStoolbox, a toolbox for remote sensing image processing and analysis such as calculating spectral indices, principal component transformation, unsupervised and supervised classification or fractional cover analyses:

install.packages("RStoolbox")

#The third package to install is ggplot2, which is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on "The Grammar of Graphics". The user provides the data, tell 'ggplot2' how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details:

install.packages("ggplot2")

#The fourth package to install is gridExtra, which provides a number of user-level functions to work with "grid" graphics, notably to arrange multiple grid-based plots on a page, and draw tables: 

install.packages("gridExtra")

#library() is a function which load and attach add-on packages, in this case the previous raster, RStoolbox, ggplot2 and gridExtra packages:

library(raster)

library(RStoolbox)

library(ggplot2)

library(gridExtra)

#In my computer R must use the folder named simply lab and I exploit a function (setwd) for the association between R and lab folder:

setwd("C:/lab/")

#Identically to the R_remote_code_sensing_first.r, I still exploit a function to import data from lab folder - external - to R - internal¬π - and this will be brick and not raster because our data does not represent raster layer objects but multi-layer raster objects!

defor1 <- brick("defor1.jpg")

#Important: the brick function creates a RasterBrick object that is a multi-layer raster object typically from a multi-layer (band) file. Instead the raster function creates a RasterLayer object from scratch, a file, an Extent object, a matrix, an 'image' object, or from a Raster *, Spatial *, im (spatstat) asc, kasc (adehabitat *), grf (geoR) or kde object!

#defor1.jpg is an image of the deforestation in the dry tropical forests of Mato Grosso (NT0140) captured by NASA's Terra satellite and downloaded from the website https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/mato-grosso-brazil

#plotRGB() is a Red-Green-Blue plot based on three layers (in a RasterBrick or RasterStack) combined such that they represent the red, green and blue channel. Through plotRGB () it is possible to graphically visualize defor1 in the colors of the visible spectrum:

plotRGB(defor1, r=1, g=2, b=3, stretch="lin")

#ggRGB() is a function that calculates RGB color composite RasterLayers for plotting with ggplot2. Optional values for clipping and and stretching can be used to enhance the imagery 

ggRGB(defor1, r=1, g=2, b=3, stretch="lin")

#The same iterative cycle of brick (), plotRGB () and ggRGB () functions must be applied to the defor2.jpg image so that an initial comparison can be made in the state of deforestation in the dry tropical forests of Mato Grosso (NT0140)

#The same iterative cycle of brick (), plotRGB () and ggRGB () functions must be applied to the defor2.jpg image so that an initial comparison can be made in the state of deforestation in the dry tropical forests of Mato Grosso (NT0140) through the function par()

#The initial comparison between defor1 and defor2 for the deforestation in the dry tropical forests of Mato Grosso (NT0140) can be graphically visualized through the plotRGB() function and in particular by organizing the previous ones in a multiframe which rÃ≤oÃ≤wÃ≤s or cÃ≤oÃ≤lÃ≤umns are at the user's discretion

#With the function par() there is the possibility of combining multiple object's level of "interest" into one graphical visualization of their called multiframe:

par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plotRGB(defor1, r=1, g=2, b=3, stretch="lin")

plotRGB(defor2, r=1, g=2, b=3, stretch="lin")

#The initial comparison in the deforestation in the dry tropical forests of Mato Grosso (NT0140) between defor1 and defor2 can also be graphically displayed through the ggRGB() function; unlike the previous function, images can be organized in a multiframe through the function grid.arrange () not before giving them a name!

D1 <- ggRGB(defor1, r=1, g=2, b=3, stretch="lin")

D2 <- ggRGB(defor2, r=1, g=2, b=3, stretch="lin")

#The classification of a satellite image depends on the reflectance values attributed to each pixel

#The values for reflectance vary in the red, green and blue (RGB) bands and two or more pixels will be "merged" to form a class if and only if they have a superimposable value

#These pixels will be placed in a multispectral region as a point cloud which, together with others in a three-dimensional reference system, define the spectrum through which the satellite image is displayed

#The above classification can be effectuated with a training set consisting of: 1) a reference satellite image and 2) the model with which there should be a classification of the pixels depending on their reflectance values or with the unsuperClass () function, where the classification of pixels depending on their reflectance values, on the other hand, occurs randomly!

#The unsupervised Classification () function randomly classifies the sampled pixels (whose number can be indicated in the nSamples argument) depending on their reflectance values, according to the number of classes selected by the user via the nClasses argument:

D1c <- unsuperClass(defor1, nClass=2)

#In the above classification, being interested in the phenomenon of deforestation, I created two classes using the nClasses argument: the first for the Amazon forest (near-infrared or NIR band displayed through the red R channel) and the second for agricultural land ( other bands displayed through the G and B channels)

#In R, to visualize information of D1c, name of it followed by Enter ‚Üµ as physical command by keyboard:
